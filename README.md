The marketing agency Horiseon has asked me to make the website meet accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

I made changes to the following aspects of the website to make sure that they met the marketing agency's standards.

* Semantic HTML Elements
* Structure the HTML elements to follow a logical structure
* Create accessible alt attributes
* Create heading attributes that fall in sequential order
* Create a concise and descriptive title
* Checked to make sure all links function correctly
* CSS selectors were consolidated and organized
